[Huawei-Research](https://github.com/huawei-research)
is the place where we keep experimental
and not-yet-ready-for-production open source products.
Even though our projects are experimental we expect their
authors to maintain them with the highest quality, according
to the best practices of open source community, including:

  * Continuous integration is a must
  * Static analysis is a must
  * Your README must [look nice](https://www.yegor256.com/2019/04/23/elegant-readme.html)
  * Your membership in huawei-research must be "public" ([edit here](https://github.com/orgs/huawei-research/people))

When you are ready to add your project here, just
[email us](mailto:yegor.bugayenko@huawei.com).
